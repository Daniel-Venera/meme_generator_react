# Meme Generator React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a meme generator, where you can generate a meme image and add the text you want.

I used an API : https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes

You can Run the app in the development mode with `yarn start`. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

I've deployed the app in GitHub Pages here : https://daniel-venera.github.io/meme_generator_react/

This is one of my first project in React so I hope you enjoy it !
